Libraries Extensions - little hacks for vanilla Emacs.

* Introduction

  An simple library that extends other libraries (mainly builtin ones) -
  a place to put new functions to be evaluated -
  little hacks to improve =Emacs (our lisp machine)= overall
  usability keeping everything more organized, providing
  a safe place to add new code/hacks.

  The =Lex= is a abbreviation for =Libraries Extensions=.

* Overview

  On =Emacs= every user also is a developer, we twist and extend
  your programmable platform (=LISP MACHINE=) to meet our needs,
  to automatize boring tasks, to become more productive -
  using smart data transformations to quickly create new features,
  analyse data and processes of interest, and more, much more!

  This is probably a continuum for the =Emacs= user life spam,
  =forever= an =user developer=, taking more and more control,
  engaging our manipulative capabilities all day long.

  So, that's why =Lex= was created to pull all this new functions
  in a common place, outside of the ~init.el~ configuration file,
  making easy to extend/reuse/modify the code that was already
  written.

  By definition the new procedures should be =little hacks=, i.e,
  naturally small.

  - FreeBSD 12.1

* Install
** Manually
   Clone =Lex= repository to a arbitrary location:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/lambdart/lex ~/.emacs.d/site-elisp/lex

   #+END_SRC

   Compile and generate the lex-autoloads.el file.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   [at-lex-root-directory]$ make all

   #+END_SRC

   Add =Lex= directory to =load-path= in your
   Emacs initialization file (~init.el~) and load it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   ;; add to load-path
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/replace/me/to/lex/full/path")

   ;; load lex basic features
   (require 'lex-autoloads nil t)

   #+END_SRC

   - Note: For a more dynamic approach, load one by one, for example:
     - =M-x load-library RET lex-uu RET=
     - =M-x load-library RET lex-load-path RET=
     - ...

* Customize

  * Note: To see all the options from =Emacs= directly, and to customize it,
    just type: =M-x customize-group RET lex-uu RET=.

  - =lex-opacity= :: The opacity value is a number/float from 0 to 1,
    with zero being fully transparent and one (1 - 100%) being fully
    opaque. Default: 0.9

  - =lex-transset= :: Program name that lets the user set the
    transparency on a window. Default: "transset"

  - =lex-transset-options= :: Default options/switches for the
    `lex-transset' program. Default: "-a"

  - =lex-slock= :: X screen locker program. Default: "slock"

  - =lex-scrot= :: Command line screen capture utility.
     Default: "scrot"

  - =lex-scrot-dir= :: The folder where captured screen images will be
    saved. Default: ~/.emacs.d/scrot/

  - =lex-mixer= :: Mixer program â€“ to set soundcard mixer values.
